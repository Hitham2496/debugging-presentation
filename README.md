Talk given at the IPPP Computing Club seminar series on debugging C++ code with `gdb` on 25-11-2021


The talk contained an instructive component and an interactive component wherein attendees traced through a toy implementation of a high energy physics (HEP) calculation to identify the source of a `nan` arising in the output.
